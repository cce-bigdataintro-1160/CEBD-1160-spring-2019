### Homework
* No more journal! Unless you want to communicate some feedback you want to be sure I'll see, no need for Journal this week! Yes, journals are over!!!

* Project
Work on your project and get that flashy presentation ready for next week.
Seriously, you can use anything you want from the README.MD of your project to a show with lasers. As long as you cover the requested scope, of course
